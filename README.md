To start using the app right away:
You will need expo installed on your machine. 
You can install it using `npm install --global expo-cli`
Once expo is instaleed:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `expo start`
On your mobile phone you need the Expo application installed. Connect your phone on the same network as the machine you are working on. Once the development server is up, from the mobile Expo application, scan the QR code shown in the cli and wait for the app to start on your device!
That's it !
